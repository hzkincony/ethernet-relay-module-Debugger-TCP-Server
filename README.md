In the VirCom network configuration tool, set the KC868-Hx controllerÂ  "Work Mode" to "TCP Client". At this time, the PC debugger is the server, and the KC868-Hx controller is the client. The server is in "Listening" state. After the controller is powered on, it will actively establish a socket communication connection with the server to realize data interaction. 

In the debugger, we demonstrate how to control the single relay switch, how to control "ALL ON", "ALL OFF" with one button, how to control the specified relay switch, how to read the current state of one relay switch, how to read the current state of all relay switches at one time, and how to read the dry node sensor state connected at the input port of controller. The bottom left of the window is the content of "send buffer"; the bottom right of the window is the content of "receive buffer". Before use, set the "port" value, then click the "Listen" button to listen and wait for the client controller to connection. After the connection is successful, the IP address and port number of the connected client device will be displayed in the software status bar.
